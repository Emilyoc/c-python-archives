Early projects done in C and Python, mainly for the course of Introduction to Computational Methods 
in the Physics Department of Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil, 2018.

Several simulations were made, focused on physical phenomena. The simulations used mainly iterative methods 
such as Euler method, Euler-Cromer method, Verlet method and Runge-Kutta method, to obtain physical trajectories in 
determinate time intervals and other quantities of interest. 

Enjoy!
